    <h1>Spring season to flowers</h1>
    <p>Gardeners use the first snowdrops, daffodils, primroses, and hellebores as a "spring marker" to count down the days until the temperatures rise again and we can spend more time in our gardens.</p>
    
    <p>For a flower to grow, it needs soil or compost, water, light, and warmth. They receive the conditions they require to start growing in the spring. The rainfall provides them with the water they require. Since there is more daylight and warmth from the Sun throughout the longer days, the temperature of the soil and the air rises. Tulips, daffodils, lily blossoms, bluebells, hyacinths, and allium are just a few examples of flowers that only bloom in spring since they can't withstand the harsh weather conditions.</p>
